# Manufacturing-Expense-Automation
This project was created to help my boss with the monthly manufacturing expense report. I will find every account related to a given expense category and add them up. At the end it converts the data collected on total spending per category into a new spreadsheet using pandas.

1. Open Main.py
2. You will be prompted to enter in the path of the "reference" document. Select the reference document in your file exployer and use the "copy path" button, don't copy paste the path at the top of the bar. (I should probably modify the code to accept both)
3. Next you will be prompted to enter the path of the "report" documentary. Once again, use the copy path button, don't manually copy/paste the path.
4. The cmd line interface will close and a new folder titled "new tracker" will appear in the same folder with the rest of the project files. Copy the value lines and paste them into column H of the "report" document.
