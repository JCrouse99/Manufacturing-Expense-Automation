# Manufacturing-Expense-Automation
This project was created to help my boss with the monthly manufacturing expense report. I will find every account related to a given expense category and add them up. At the end it converts the data collected on total spending per category into a new spreadsheet using pandas.

This is a test change. I want to see if I can still push this after removing a few SSH keys I'm no longer using.
